## About this boring person

- mental state not always stable (sanity is optional)
- uses linux (btw)
- overengineer stuffs then finds out there already a lib for that
- front-end design/developing (creating buttons that either work or destroy the backend)
- designs buttons. big buttons. shiny buttons. buttons that gaslight users
- system & infrastructure engineering (build blazing fast api that _might_ even return a correct response)
- full-stack developer, caused problems accross the entire stack
- wrote my own auth flow once. still recovering from the trauma
- thinks svelte transitions are more emotionally responsive than some people
- uses 10 languages but is fluent in none
- `1 + 1 = hello world`
- allergic to plain CSS
- believes in writing scalable code. scales all the way up to a 404
- documents nothing during development. explains everything after deployment
- scared of chopping wood because the axe might generate log files
- everything is an edge case if you believe hard enough
- fixed a bug by deleting the feature
- builds things that donâ€™t need to exist. maintains them out of spite
- git commit messages are either "fix" or "gay"
- opens 347 tabs to read docs, reads none
- if i said something will be done in 1 hours. just let me do it peacefully. dont notify me every 2 hours
- sudo anythings that doesnt work
- real man test in production
- reads error logs like ancient runes
- spend 6 hours automating a 3-minute task
- `z-index: 999999999;`
- json responses are more organized than my desk
